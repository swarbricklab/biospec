# Relationships

<!-- Rationale: Not sure if this one is more user-focussed or agent focused, but the idea is a framework to help establish relationships between entities between documents, like research questions and data. For example, caapturing the extent to which the data can answer a given research question, and whether the analysis tasks needed to achieve this are within project scope. Basically, captures interactions between different project spec docs to help refine goals and data requirements. -->

# Research Questions/Aims vs Datasets
- Describe what each dataset (`datasets.md`) can contribute to each RQ/aim (`intent.md`)
- What are the pros and cons of each dataset for answering their target RQ/aim?

# Scope Check 
- Are the goals (`intent.md`) aligned with the scope in `project_overview.md`?
